# Nakli.Tech

Source code repository for [Nakli.Tech](https://nakli.tech) website 

**Owner:** Shubham Oli [oli.shubham@gmail.com]

Website itself is build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a super cool Golang based framework for building static websites. 

And, the site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which is again super awesome and my bet for deploying websites build on [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/).
